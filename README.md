### 3D Visualization of Cosmological Simulations of Early Cosmic Structure Formation

This is a student project I completed after my 3rd year at the University of Edinburgh at the Royal Observatory Edinburgh under the supervision of PhD student Ben Morton and Prof. Sadegh Khochfar.
The aim of this project is to visualize the cosmological simulations ran and created by Prof. Khochfar's research group and create animations to be used at presentations and conferences.

This project was mainly coded using the yt package that aids visualization of cosmological simulations. The current program can create animations by stringing yt generated images together 
and producing a single .mov file based on the inputs of the user. There are 4 animations available at the moment: move, rotate, zoom and rotate&zoom and each of these can be centered on any desired object.
A detailed description of the required input parameters and recommended values can be found in the Code Report.
